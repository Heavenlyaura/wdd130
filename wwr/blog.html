                <P class="blog-p1">
                    Make sure to reserve your date now, as our trips have limited availability and they tend to fill up quickly. If you have specific dates in mind for your river adventure, it is advisable to book as soon as possible to secure your spot. Our trips are highly sought after, and once the dates are gone, they're gone. <br>

                    Let's take a moment to reflect on the highlights from our past season. It was truly an incredible year for us as we celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the majestic Grand Canyon. Over the course of the season, we embarked on 36 unforgettable journeys down the Grand Canyon, introducing more than 800 people to one of the most awe-inspiring places on Earth. <br>
                    
                    In addition to our seasoned crew, we were thrilled to welcome four new guides into our close-knit family. They underwent rigorous training to ensure they were well-prepared to provide an exceptional experience for our guests. <br>
                    
                    As the season kicked off, we experienced some chilly weather during the early months. However, our adventurous guests embraced the cold and embraced every moment of their trip. Despite the initial chill, they were rewarded with breathtaking views and unforgettable memories. <br>
                    
                    Our skilled guides navigated the rivers expertly, ensuring the safety and enjoyment of our guests throughout their journey. They shared their vast knowledge of the landscape, pointing out hidden gems and highlighting the natural wonders that make these rivers so remarkable. <br>
                    
                    Whether it was tackling exhilarating rapids, marveling at the towering canyon walls, or simply basking in the serenity of the surroundings, every moment on the water was filled with awe and wonder. <br>
                     
                    So, if you're seeking an extraordinary adventure and an opportunity to explore the wonders of the Grand Canyon or the Salmon River, don't hesitate to reserve your spot now. Join us on an unforgettable journey and create memories that will last a lifetime. <br>

                <h3>Encounters in the wild!</h3>
                <P class="blog-p2">
                    
                    Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to face with one. <br>
                    
                    Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are not on that list! <br>
                    
                    They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice, aspirin and time. <br>
                    
                    When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately. <br>
                    
                    Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators. <br>
                    
                    Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting. <br>
                    
                    If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
        
            <div class="faq1">
                <p><strong>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</strong>  <br> <br>
                    Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

            <div class="faq2">
                <p>  <strong>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</strong> <br><br>
                    Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
                    Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>
            </div>
                    
             <div class="faq3">
                <p> <strong>What is included in the trip?</strong>  <br><br>
                    We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. <br>
                    We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks</p>

            <div class="faq4">
                <p> <strong>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come? </strong><br> <br>
                    As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>
