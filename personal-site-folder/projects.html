                    I have developed a Python program that calculates life expectancy for individuals across a specific range of countries and a given time frame. This program efficiently processes a large volume of raw data, allowing users to obtain valuable insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By analyzing the data set, the program determines the lowest and highest ages recorded, providing a comprehensive overview of the age range. Additionally, it identifies the country with the highest and lowest life expectancy, giving users a glimpse into the variations across different nations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the program allows users to input a specific year of interest. It then retrieves the country with the highest and lowest life expectancy for that particular year. This feature enables users to explore temporal variations in life expectancy and understand how countries have progressed or regressed over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this Python program provides a powerful tool for analyzing life expectancy trends across various countries and time periods. It facilitates data-driven decision-making, aids researchers in studying global health patterns, and offers valuable insights to policymakers striving to improve public health outcomes.

                    I have developed a Python program that performs data analysis on a PDF file. The       program extracts tables present within the PDF file, converts them into CSV format, and then processes the extracted information based on the user's specific requirements. <br><br>

                    By leveraging advanced algorithms, the program effectively identifies tables within the PDF file, ensuring accurate extraction of tabular data. The extracted tables are then transformed into CSV files, a widely used format for data manipulation and analysis. <br><br>
                    
                    Once the tables are converted to CSV, the program provides customizable data processing functionalities. Users can define specific operations, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, or performing calculations on the extracted data. This flexibility allows users to derive meaningful insights and draw conclusions from the information contained within the PDF file.
                    <br><br>
                    In summary, this Python program simplifies the process of analyzing data from PDF files. It automates the extraction of tables, enables efficient conversion to CSV format, and empowers users to perform tailored data processing operations. With this program, users can unlock the potential of data within PDF files and derive valuable insights to support decision-making and analysis.
